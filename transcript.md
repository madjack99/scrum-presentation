# SCRUM

## A Quick Explanation of Scrum

Scrum is a lightweight and agile approach to project management that breaks down a product into smaller tasks, and places them on a list called a backlog.

Tasks are taken from the backlog, in the order they need to be completed, and given to teams who work to get the job done within a set timeframe called a sprint.
Sprints lasts an average of two weeks, depending on the project’s timeframe and complexity of the task.

## Overview

The first thing anyone unfamiliar with Scrum should know is that while it is a simple concept, it can be challenging to successfully implement.

Companies who use Scrum can tackle larger projects easier and faster with a much higher degree of efficiency. For workers, Scrum Mastery is becoming essential for anyone wanting to move up in their careers and lead teams working on large or complex projects. Scrum goes beyond the standard management command and control model, and instead hinges on an active leadership role. The leader of a team using scrum is less like a coach standing and directing the sidelines, and more like the team captain who is in the game as much as everyone else.

Almost any company or complex project can benefit from using the Scrum method. Like with any major undertaking, the right person to run the project has to be found. Scrum is dependent on having knowledgeable, dedicated, and hardworking personnel on a project. Without this key element, projects are likely to be riddled with all manner of problems.

## History

The history of Scrum goes back to 1986 when Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka first used the term to describe a more efficient way to approach product development. The word Scrum comes from the game of Rugby, and refers to when a team huddles close together and charges in an attempt to get the ball from the opposing team.

In the 1990’s Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland used and refined this method specifically for software development, since the predictive and waterfall methods weren’t always a good fit. They combined their practices, ideas, and observations and created what is officially known as Scrum. They presented their findings at OOPSLA (Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications) in 1995, and Scrum is now the most popular agile project management methodology for most industries.

Scrum was originally designed for software developers, but has now been adopted and modified to work with nearly any complex product design or project. The people who use scrum the most are the managers and team leaders who are in charge of several groups or departments; i.e. the ones whose heads get served up to shareholders if projects aren’t successfully completed.

## The Pros and Cons of Scrum

Like with any project management method, Scrum has its strengths and weaknesses. These are largely dependent on the nature of the project and who is on your team. Agile management methods like Scrum are easy to adapt to the quirks and different personalities working on a project, and they allow people to adapt to changes in scope or end goals.

It’s not a magic button that will suddenly solve all the problems plaguing a project, change a dysfunctional team into seasoned pros, or turn a complex and challenging tasks into something that’s a breeze. It has to be learned and mastered, just like any other skill.

Scrum has numerous benefits for everyone involved on a project, from investors to workers. One major benefit from using this method is how it facilitates efficient ways to utilize time and money. Investors and upper management are always happy when a project comes in on time and within budget. There are several other benefits from using Scrum for managing projects:

### Pros:

- Team members have a clearer picture of their tasks. They know what they have to do, and any questions can be taken care of immediately or worked out during their next sprint.
- Feedback from customers and backers can be easily integrated during the process, and the agile nature of Scrum allows changes based on that feedback to be done more smoothly.
- Big projects are divided up into smaller parts which are easier to manage and complete.
- What is being produced can be reviewed and tested, during the creation phase.
- It’s easy to know how much work and effort individual team members are contributing to the project.
  No system is perfect, and as adaptive as Scrum is, it can’t cover all situations. It’s also as vulnerable to the human element as anything else. Above all, Scrum is dependent on having workers who are competent, dedicated, and willing to work as part of a team.

Teams can fall apart or implode, if members are uncooperative, overly competitive, or generally uncommitted to the project. There are other drawbacks that can occur when using the Scrum method.

### Cons:

- Scope Creep: A project can bloat as the lack of a definitive end can lead to more and more things being added on.
- Team members have to be experienced. Rookies can get overwhelmed by the pressure and demands of a sprint. It can throw a wrench into the whole project, even with a veteran leading them.
- Large teams can have trouble adapting to and fully utilizing the agile nature of the Scrum method. Which leaves the question, how big is too big?
- Quality assurance can be a problem, even with testing. Too often teams will throw a band-aid on a problem, and the goal of getting something done becomes more important than getting it right.
- Losing a team member can have major negative consequences for both the project and their team.

## Scrum workflow. Sprints

The Scrum model suggests that projects progress via a series of sprints. In keeping with an agile methodology, sprints are timeboxed to no more than a month long, most commonly two weeks.

Scrum methodology advocates for a planning meeting at the start of the sprint, where team members figure out how many items they can commit to, and then create a sprint backlog – a list of the tasks to perform during the sprint.

During an agile Scrum sprint, the Scrum team takes a small set of features from idea to coded and tested functionality. At the end, these features are done, meaning coded, tested and integrated into the evolving product or system.

On each day of the sprint, all team members should attend a daily Scrum meeting, including the ScrumMaster and the product owner. This meeting is timeboxed to no more than 15 minutes. During that time, team members share what they worked on the prior day, will work on that day, and identify any impediments to progress.
The Scrum model sees daily scrums as a way to synchronize the work of team members as they discuss the work of the sprint.

At the end of a sprint, the team conducts a sprint review during which the team demonstrates the new functionality to the PO or any other stakeholder who wishes to provide feedback that could influence the next sprint.

This feedback loop within Scrum software development may result in changes to the freshly delivered functionality, but it may just as likely result in revising or adding items to the product backlog.

Another activity in Scrum project management is the sprint retrospective at the end of each sprint. The whole team participates in this meeting, including the ScrumMaster and PO. The meeting is an opportunity to reflect on the sprint that has ended, and identify opportunities to improve.

## Scrum workflow. Artifacts

The primary artifact in Scrum development is, of course, the product itself. The Scrum model expects the team to bring the product or system to a potentially shippable state at the end of each Scrum sprint.

The product backlog is another artifact of Scrum. This is the complete list of the functionality that remains to be added to the product. The product owner prioritizes the backlog so the team always works on the most valuable features first.

The most popular and successful way to create a product backlog using Scrum methodology is to populate it with user stories, which are short descriptions of functionality described from the perspective of a user or customer.

In Scrum project management, on the first day of a sprint and during the planning meeting, team members create the sprint backlog. The sprint backlog can be thought of as the team's to-do list for the sprint, whereas a product backlog is a list of features to be built (written in the form of user stories).

The sprint backlog is the list of tasks the team needs to perform in order to deliver the functionality it committed to deliver during the sprint.
Additional artifacts resulting from the Scrum agile methodology is the sprint burn down chart and release burn down chart. Burn down charts show the amount of work remaining either in a sprint or a release, and are an effective tool in Scrum software development to determine whether a sprint or release is on schedule to have all planned work finished by the desired date.

## The Agile Scrum Project: Main Roles

### ScrumMaster

Even if you are new to Scrum, you may have heard of a role called the ScrumMaster. The ScrumMaster is the team's coach, and helps Scrum practitioners achieve their highest level of performance.

In the Scrum process, a ScrumMaster differs from a traditional project manager in many ways, including that this role does not provide day-to-day direction to the team and does not assign tasks to individuals.

A good ScrumMaster shelters the team from outside distractions, allowing team members to focus maniacally during the sprint on the goal they have selected.

### Product owner

While the ScrumMaster focuses on helping the team be the best that it can be, the product owner works to direct the team to the right goal. The product owner does this by creating a compelling vision of the product, and then conveying that vision to the team through the product backlog.

The product owner is responsible for prioritizing the backlog during Scrum development, to ensure it’s up to par as more is learned about the system being built, its users, the team and so on.

### Team itself

The third and final role in Scrum project management is the Scrum team itself. Although individuals may join the team with various job titles, in Scrum, those titles are insignificant. Scrum methodology states that each person contributes in whatever way they can to complete the work of each sprint.

This does not mean that a tester will be expected to re-architect the system; individuals will spend most (and sometimes all) of their time working in whatever discipline they worked before adopting the agile Scrum model. But with Scrum, individuals are expected to work beyond their preferred disciplines whenever doing so would be for the good of the team.

## Analogy

One way to think of the interlocking nature of these three roles in this agile methodology is as a race car.

The Scrum team is the car itself, ready to speed along in whatever direction it is pointed. The product owner is the driver, making sure that the car is always going in the right direction. And the ScrumMaster is the chief mechanic, keeping the car well tuned and performing at its best.

## Scrum in Action

There are near endless examples of Scrum being used in various projects. Scrum has even made it into the hit HBO series Silicon Valley. In real life, several companies have used Scrum to great effect. One of the most notable is Amazon.
There is no question that Amazon is a behemoth, and one of the ways they got to where they are is the aggressive and widespread use of Scrum. It fits well within the retail giant’s corporate culture of giving management autonomy and wide discretionary latitude when it comes to problem solving.
